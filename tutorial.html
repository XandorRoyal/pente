            <h2>Object of the Game</h2>
            <p>
                There are two ways to win.
                Win by getting five (or more) stones in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, with no empty points in between.
                Or, win by capturing five (or more) pairs of your opponents' stones.
            </p>

            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>
                The game will start with the board completely cleared.
                The first player begins the game by playing one stone on the center point.
                Thereafter players take turns playing their stones, one at a time, on any empty intersection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stones are played on the intersections of the lines, including the edge of the board, rather than in the squares.
                A move is completed when the stone is placed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once played, a stone cannot be moved again, except when removed by a capture.
                The players take turns adding new stones to the board, building up their positions until someone wins.
            </p>

            <h2>Etiquette</h2>
            <p>
                The game will announce if either player has Tria (3-in-a-row) or Tessera (4-in-a-row) 
                to remind the other player not to forget to stop the formation of five.
            </p>
